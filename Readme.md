# Mods Base
A common set of classes for describing mods made with
[pyunrealsdk](https://github.com/bl-sdk/pyunrealsdk/), as well as various common utilities.

Aimed at the Borderlands series, though likely suitable for others with slight modification.

### Setting up a new Mod Manager
While this repo contains all the base info for a new mod manager, you still need to add a few other
game specific things:

- A mod menu. Consider using [console_mod_menu](https://github.com/bl-sdk/console_mod_menu/)
  while developing, though you likely want to create a gui version for users.

- A keybind implementation, which overwrites `KeybindType._enable` and `KeybindType._disable` (and
  possibly `KeybindType._rebind`), and sets up some hooks to run the callbacks as appropriate.

- An initialization script. This should import this and the keybind implementation, then find and
  import all mods, and finally call `mods_base.mod_list.register_base_mod`

# Changelog

### v1.10
- Added the `ObjectFlags` enum, holding a few known useful flags.

- Moved a few warnings to go through Python's system, so they get attributed to the right place.

- Added a warning for initializing a non-integer slider option with `is_integer=True` (the default).

- Added support for BL1.

### v1.9
- Added a new `CoopSupport.HostOnly` value.

- Added a helper `RestartToDisable` mod class, for mods which need a restart to fully disable.

- Specifying a custom class when calling `build_mod` now type hints returning an instance of it,
  instead of just `Mod`.

- `SliderOption`s now throw if initialized with a step larger than their allowed range.

- Added `_(to|from)_json()` methods to all options, and changed settings saving and loading to use
  them.

### v1.8
- Fixed that nested and grouped options' children would not get their `.mod` attribute set.

### v1.7
- The "Update Available" notification should now immediately go away upon updating, instead of
  waiting a day for the next check.

- Changed the functions the keybind implementation should overwrite from `KeybindType.enable` to
  `KeybindType._enable` (+ same for disable). These functions don't need to set `is_enabled`.

### v1.6
- Changed default type of `HookType` generic type hint to any, so that by default pre and post hooks
  can be combined under the same type. As an example, previously if you passed an explicit hook list
  to `build_mod`, the type hinting would only accept a list where all hooks were of the same type.

- Fixed that defining an option, keybind, hook, or command as a class member, and then constructing
  it via the `build_mod` factory, would pass empty lists to the constructor and thus prevent the
  auto member collection from running.

- Changed the display version to be sourced from `mod_manager.display_version` in the unrealsdk
  config file, rather than an environment variable.

- Gave `@command` and `ArgParseCommand.add_argument` default type hinting for the args they forward.

### v1.5
- Added a default `rlm` command, which is a helper to reload Python modules during development.
- Deprecated the `auto_enable` arg in the `@hook` decorator, since it was misleading and in 99% of
  cases was not needed.
- Reworked `@hook` decorator internals to better support use on methods. It essentially creates a
  factory, which must be bound to the specific object before use. This is done automatically on mod
  instances.
- `KeybindOption.from_keybind()` now forwards the `default_key` -> `default_value`, so that
  resetting to default works consistently.
  
### Older
Versions 1.0 through 1.4 were developed as part of the
[oak-mod-manager](https://github.com/bl-sdk/oak-mod-manager/blob/master/changelog.md#v14), see it
for a full changelog.
